This little project is intended to be a client-server system. The server is written in python
and runs on a router (specifically a NAT router). It accepts connections from the client. It
opens ports for a set amount of time (specified in seconds), and then closes the hole. It is
designed so that you can open a port for yourself wherever you are. It uses XMLRPC for
communication. The client is written in PHP. Technically, no authentication is necessary,
but I figured it would be a good idea to force people to log in. Once logged in, users can
open ports for themselves using the web interface.

The usage scenario for this is simple. I'm at home, I want to access a service at work (which
sadly lives behind a NAT). I log in to the website with my LDAP credentials, open a few
ports for myself, and now I'm cooking with fire (or whatever the kids are cooking with these
days).

As with all things I create, you run the risk of destroying the economy, your soul, and all baby
kittens everywhere if you run this software. You've been warned.
